# Understand storage classes, persistent volumes

A `StorageClass` provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes itself is un-opinionated about what classes represent. This concept is sometimes called "profiles" in other storage systems.

An example of a storage class is below:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
mountOptions:
  - debug
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

Key declarations are:

* `provisioner` : Determine which volume plugin to use. This usually matches to a cloud provider, and a specific storage service that it offers. In this example AWS Elastic Block Store

* `parameters` : Describe characteristics of this storage class in context of the underlying provisioner. In this example, the `type` is `gp2` which, in AWS lingo means General Purpose SSD. Other types include `IO1` (Provisioned IOPS), `ST1` (Throughput Optimised) and `STC` (Cold Storage).

A `storageclass` object by itself defines what storage is provisioned *when it is invoked*. By itself, it does nothing.

A `persistentvolume` object can be used to request storage from a `storageclass` and is typically part of a pod manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0003
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  storageClassName: standard
```

# Understand volume mode, access modes and reclaim policies for volumes

## Volume modes:

Only two exist:

* `block` - Mounted to a pod as a raw block device *without* a filesystem. The Pod / application needs to understand how to deal with raw block devices. Presenting it in this way can yield better performance, at the expense of complexity.

* `filesystem` - Mounted inside a pods' filesystem inside a directory. If the volume is backed by a block device with no filesystem, Kubernetes will create one. Compared to `block` devices, this method offers the highest compatibility, at the expense of performance.

## Access Modes

Three options exist:

*  `ReadWriteOnce` – The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
*  `ReadOnlyMany` – The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
*  `ReadWriteMany` – The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

# Understand persistent volume claims primitive

A `PersistentVolume` can be thought of as storage provisioned by an administrator. Think of this as pre-allocation

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` can be thought of as storage requested by a user/workload. 

When the user creates PVC to request storage, Kubernetes will try to match that PVC with a pre-allocated PV. If a match can be found, the PVC will be bound to the PV, and the user will start to use that pre-allocated piece of storage.


# Know how to configure applications with persistent storage

When not using storageclasses there are a number of steps:

Create the PV: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Create the workload to leverage this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pv-claim
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage
```

If leveraging a storageclass, a `persistentvolume` object is not required, we just need a `persistentvolumeclaim`


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: myStorageClass
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pv-claim
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage
```
