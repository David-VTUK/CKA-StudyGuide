If you need to get boilerplate YAML manifests to address an exam question, feel free to get them from here. The key is to know what to search for. For example, if asked to create and apply a service object, search for Service YAML in the Kubernetes docs and modify an example to suit the question objectives. Caution on documentation When using the Kubernetes.io docs, be careful of the search results - some will point to resources outside of kubernetes.io and the list of accepted resource for the exam.

To determine who (or what) has access to which resources, a number of steps have to be executed. Step 1 - Authentication First step is Authentication which is how a user or service account identifies itself. Depending on the source, a corresponding authentication module is used. Authentication modules include the ability to authenticate from the following: Client Certificate Password Plain Tokens Bootstrap Tokens JWT Tokens (for service accounts) All authentication is handled via HTTP over TLS. Step 2 - Authorization After a user or service account is authenticated, the request must then be authorized. Any authentication request is followed by some kind of action request, and the action defines the object(s) that request needs to apply to, and what the action is. For example, to list the pods in a given namespace. Any and all requests are facilitated providing an existing policy gives the user those permissions. Steps 3 & 4 - Admission Control Admission Control Modules are software modules that can modify or reject requests. In addition to the attributes available to Authorization Modules, Admission Control Modules can access the contents of the object that is being created or updated. They act on objects being created, deleted, updated or connected (proxy), but not reads. Role and Rolebindings Implementing RBAC rules largely involves two object types within Kubernetes - role and rolebindings : A role grants access to resources within a single namespace. A rolebinding grants the permissions from a role to a user, group or service account within a single namespace. clusterrole and clusterrolebindings operate similarly, but obviously provide access to non-namespaced resources. kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false can be used to determine which resource types are not namespaced. Examples include: node , persistentvolume , storageclass and users . Users can either be serviceaccounts or users . The former is typically used to authenticate applications, the latter for human users. To test, the below creates namespace , serviceaccount , role and rolebinding apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: rbac-test apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: rbac-test-sa namespace: rbac-test ``` of particular importance is the format of the below. `apiGroup` : Determines which API group to apply this to. `resources`: Which resource types to apply this to. `verbs`: What we can do to these objects (ie create, delete, watch, etc) ```yaml apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: rbac-test-role namespace: rbac-test rules: - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"pods\"] verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"] apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: rbac-test-rolebinding namespace: rbac-test roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: rbac-test-role subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: rbac-test-sa namespace: rbac-test We can then validate this with kubectl.

It takes care of the etcd cluster, Kubernetes master and worker nodes including all the required components to instantiate a viable minimum k8s cluster. What you get at the end of using kubeadm is a fully working, fully functioning kubernetes cluster. It's at the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of difficulty compared to, for example, Kelsey Hightower's \"Kubernetes the hard way\". For the exam, it is recommended that you become familiar with both ways of deploying Kubernetes clusters. Kubeadm is a command line utility that performs the following functions: kubeadm init to bootstrap a Kubernetes control-plane node kubeadm join to bootstrap a Kubernetes worker node and join it to the cluster kubeadm upgrade to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster to a newer version kubeadm config if you initialized your cluster using kubeadm v1.7.x or lower, to configure your cluster for kubeadm upgrade kubeadm token to manage tokens for kubeadm join kubeadm reset to revert any changes made to this host by kubeadm init or kubeadm join kubeadm version to print the kubeadm version kubeadm alpha to preview a set of features made available for gathering feedback from the community Kubeadm - Master Node Install In the following examples 3x Ubuntu Server VMs were created k8s-cl02-ms01 k8s-cl02-wk01 k8s-cl02-wk02 Where appropriate, ensure your nodes have a container runtime installed.

Once completed, a message will be displayed: Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully! To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user: mkdir -p $HOME/.kube sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.

For workers, we use \"kubeadm join\". As prep: Install a container runtime Install the kubeadm binaries (as above) To join a worker node to a cluster created by kubeadm we need to use the kubeadm join command with a token generated on the master.

Several topologies exist for doing so: Stacked etcd Multiple worker nodes Multiple control plane nodes fronted by a loadbalancer Embedded etcd within control plane Notes: etcd is quorum based. Therefore, if using stacked control plane nodes with etcd, odd numbers must be used. External etcd Notes: Multiple worker nodes Multiple control plane nodes fronted by a loadbalancer Etcd is external of the k8s cluster Notes: Advantage with this setup is etcd and the control plane can be scaled and managed independently of each other. This provides greater flexibility at the expense of operational complexity. Assessing cluster health kubectl get componentstatus is deprecated as of 1.20. A suitable replacement includes probing the API server directly, For example, on a master node, run curl -k https://localhost:6443/livez?verbose which returns: [+]ping ok [+]log ok [+]etcd ok [+]poststarthook/start-kube-apiserver-admission-initializer ok [+]poststarthook/generic-apiserver-start-informers ok .....etc Three endpoints exist - healthz , livez and readyz to indicate the current status of the API server Provision underlying infrastructure to deploy a Kubernetes cluster The topology choices above will influence the underlying resources that need to be provisioned. How these are provisioned are specific to the underlying cloud provider. Some generic observations: Disable swap. Leverage cloud capabilities for HA - ie using multiple AZ's. Windows can be used for worker nodes, but not control plane. Perform a version upgrade on a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm First, install kubeadm to a specific version. This will determine the k8s version that it deploys: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.19.0-00 kubelet=1.19.0-00 kubectl=1.19.0-00 && sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm Stand up a k8s cluster sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 Add CNI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml To upgrade the underlying k8s cluster, we need to upgrade kubeadm. Update kubeadm sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade kubeadm Next we plan the upgrade - this won't change our cluster but will display what changes can be made: sudo kubeadm upgrade plan Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply': COMPONENT CURRENT AVAILABLE kubelet 1 x v1.19.0 v1.20.2 Upgrade to the latest stable version: COMPONENT CURRENT AVAILABLE kube-apiserver v1.19.7 v1.20.2 kube-controller-manager v1.19.7 v1.20.2 kube-scheduler v1.19.7 v1.20.2 kube-proxy v1.19.7 v1.20.2 CoreDNS 1.7.0 1.7.0 etcd 3.4.9-1 3.4.13-0 You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command: kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.2 Important note: kubelet must be upgraded manually after this step.

Should we need to make changes, we apply this to the deployment object, not individual pods. Because of the declarative nature of deployments , Kubernetes will rectify any changes between desired and running state, and rectify accordingly. For example, if we manually deleted. We can then describe it with kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment Update To update an existing deployment, we have two main options: Rolling Update Recreate A rolling update, as the name implies, will swap out containers in a deployment with one created by a new image. Use a rolling update when the application supports having a mix of different pods (aka application versions). This method will also involve no downtime of the service, but will take longer to bring up the deployment to the requested version. Old and new versions of the pod spec will coexist until they're all rotated. A recreation will delete all the existing pods and then spin up new ones. This method will involve downtime.

Obviously, the first step is to create a config map before we can get pods to use them: kubectl create configmap <map-name> <data-source> \u201cMap-name\u201d is an arbitrary name we give to this particular map, and \u201cdata-source\u201d corresponds to a key-value pair that resides in the config map. kubectl create configmap vt-cm --from-literal=blog=virtualthoughts.co.uk At which point we can then describe it: kubectl describe configmap vt-cm Name: vt-cm Namespace: default Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Data ==== blog: ---- virtualthoughts.co.uk To reference this config map in a pod, we declare it in the respective yaml: Configmaps can be mounted as volumes or environment variables .

BLOG_NAME=virtualthoughts.co.uk ... Know how to scale applications Constantly adding more, individual pods is not a sustainable model for scaling an application. To facilitate applications at scale, we need to leverage higher level constructs such as replicasets or deployments. As mentioned previously, deployments provide us with a single administrative unit to manage the underlying pods. We can scale a deployment object to increase the number of pods . As an example, if the following is deployed: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-deployment spec: replicas: 5 template: metadata: labels: app: nginx-frontend spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.14 ports: - containerPort: 80 If we wanted to scale this, we can simply modify the yaml file and scale up/down the deployment by modifying the \u201creplicas\u201d field, or modify it in the fly: kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas 10 Understand the primitives used to create robust, self-healing, application deployments Deployments facilitate this by employing a reconciliation loop to check the number of deployed pods matches what\u2019s defined in the manifest. Under the hood, deployments leverage ReplicaSets, which are primarily responsible for this feature. Stateful Sets are similar to deployments, for example they manage the deployment and scaling of a series of pods. However, in addition to deployments they also provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods. A StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: StatefulSet metadata: name: nginx-statefulset spec: selector: matchLabels: app: vt-nginx serviceName: \"nginx\" replicas: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: vt-nginx spec: containers: - name: vt-nginx image: nginx:1.7.9 ports: - containerPort: 80 Understand how resource limits can affect Pod scheduling At a namespace level, we can define resource limits. This enables a restriction in resources, especially helpful in multi-tenancy environments and provides a mechanism to prevent pods from consuming more resources than permitted, which may have a detrimental effect on the environment as a whole. We can define the following: Default memory / CPU requests & limits for a namespace Minimum and Maximum memory / CPU constraints for a namespace Memory/CPU Quotas for a namespace Default Requests and Limits If a container is created in a namespace with a default request/limit value and doesn't explicitly define these in the manifest, it inherits these values from the namespace Note, if you define a container with a memory/CPU limit, but not a request, Kubernetes will define the limit the same as the request. Minimum / Maximum Constraints If a pod does not meet the range in which the constraints are valued at, it will not be scheduled. Quotas Control the total amount of CPU/memory that can be consumed in the namespace as a whole. Example: Attempt to schedule a pod that request more memory than defined in the namespace Create a namespace: kubectl create namespace tenant-mem-limited Create a YAML manifest to limit resources: apiVersion: v1 kind: LimitRange metadata: name: tenant-max-mem namespace: tenant-mem-limited spec: limits: - max: memory: 250Mi type: Container Apply this to the aforementioned namespace: kubectl apply -f maxmem.yaml To create a pod with a memory request that exceeds the limit: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: too-much-memory namespace: tenant-mem-limited spec: containers: - name: too-much-mem image: nginx resources: requests: memory: \"300Mi\" Executing the above will yield the following result: The Pod \"too-much-memory\" is invalid: spec.containers[0].resources.requests: Invalid value: \"300Mi\": must be less than or equal to memory limit As we have defined the pod limit of the namespace to 250MiB, a request for 300MiB will fail. Awareness of manifest management and common templating tools Kustomize Kustomize is a templating tool for Kubernetes manifests in its native form (Yaml). When working with raw YAML files you will typically have a directory containing several files identifying the resources it creates. To begin, a directory containing our manifests needs to exist: /home/david/app/base total 16 drwxrwxr-x 2 david david 4096 Feb 9 11:44 . drwxr-xr-x 27 david david 4096 Feb 9 11:44 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 340 Feb 9 11:09 deployment.yaml -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 153 Feb 9 11:09 service.yaml This will form our base - we will build on this but adding customisations in the form of overlays. First, we need a kustomize file. which can be created with kustomize create --autodetect This will create kustomization.yaml in the current directory: total 20 drwxrwxr-x 2 david david 4096 Feb 9 11:47 . drwxr-xr-x 27 david david 4096 Feb 9 11:47 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 340 Feb 9 11:09 deployment.yaml -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 108 Feb 9 11:47 kustomization.yaml -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 153 Feb 9 11:09 service.yaml The contents being: apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Kustomization resources: - deployment.yaml - service.yaml Variants and Overlays variant - Divergence in configuration from the base overlay - Composes variants together Say, for example, we wanted to generate manifests for different environments (prod and dev) that are based from this config, but have additional customisations. In this example we will create a dev variant encapsulated in a single Overlay mkdir -p overlays/{dev,prod} cd overlays/dev Begin by creating a Kustomization object specifying the base (this will create kustomization.yaml ) : kustomize create --resources ../../base In this example, I want to change the replica count to 1, as it's a dev environment. In the dev directory, create a new file deployment.yaml containing: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: app: nginx name: nginx-deployment spec: replicas: 1 The kustomization.yaml file needs modifying to include a patchesStrategicMerge block: apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Kustomization bases: - ../../base patchesStrategicMerge: - deployment.yaml Patches can be used to apply different customizations to Resources. Kustomize supports different patching mechanisms through patchesStrategicMerge and patchesJson6902 . patchesStrategicMerge is a list of file paths. We can generate the manifests and apply to the cluster by executing (from the base folder): kustomize build ./overlay/dev | kubectl apply -f - By running this, only 1 pod will be created in the deployment object, instead of what's defined in the base because of the customisation we've applied. We can do the same with prod, or any arbitrary number of environments. Helm Helm is synonymous to what apt or yum are in the Linux world. It's effectively a package manager for Kubernetes. \"Packages\" in Helm are called charts to which you can customise with your own values. It's unlikely the exam will require anyone to create a helm chart from scratch, but an understanding of how it works is a good idea. Helm Repos Repos are where helm charts are stored. Typically, a repo will contain a number of charts to choose from. Helm can be managed by a CLI client, and a repo can be added by running: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami To list the packages from this repo: helm search repo bitnami To install a package from this repo: helm install my-release bitnami/mariadb Where my-release is a string identifying an installed instance of this application Parameters that can be customised - are dependent on how the chart is configured. For the aforementioned MariaDB chart, they are listed at https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mariadb/#parameters These values are encapsulated in the corresponding values.yaml file in the repo. You can populate an instance of it and apply it with: helm install -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/charts/master/bitnami/mariadb/values.yaml my-release bitnami/mariadb Alternatively, variables can be declared by using --set , such as: helm install my-release --set auth.rootPassword=secretpassword bitnami/mariadb","title":"Part Two - Workloads & Scheduling"},{"location":"revision-topics/02-workloads-and-scheduling/#workloads-and-scheduling","text":"","title":"Workloads and Scheduling"},{"location":"revision-topics/02-workloads-and-scheduling/#understand-deployments-and-how-to-perform-rolling-update-and-rollbacks","text":"Deployments are intended to replace Replication Controllers.

Each host is responsible for one subnet of the CNI range. In this example, the left host is responsible for 10.1.1.0/24, and the right host 10.1.2.0/24. The overall pod CIDR block may be something like 10.1.0.0/16. Virtual ethernet adapters are paired with a corresponding Pod network adapter. Kernel routing is used to enable Pods to communicate outside the host it resides in. Understand connectivity between Pods Every Pod gets its own IP address. This means you do not need to explicitly create links between Pods, and you almost never need to deal with mapping container ports to host ports. This creates a clean, backwards-compatible model where Pods can be treated much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration. Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies): Pods on a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT Agents on a node (e.g. system daemons, Kubelet) can communicate with all pods on that node Note: When running workloads that leverage hostNetwork : Pods in the host network of a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT Understand ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer service types and endpoints Pods are ephemeral. Therefore, placing these behind a service which provides a stable, static entrypoint is a fundamental use of the kubernetes service object. To reiterate, services take the form of the following: ClusterIP - Internal only LoadBalancer - External, requires cloud provider, or software implementation to provide one NodePort - External, requires access the nodes directly Ingress resource - L7 An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, and offer name based virtual hosting. An Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a loadbalancer, though it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic. Know how to use Ingress controllers and Ingress resources Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within a cluster. Ingress consists of two components. Ingress Resource is a collection of rules for the inbound traffic to reach Services. These are Layer 7 (L7) rules that allow hostnames (and optionally paths) to be directed to specific Services in Kubernetes. The second component is the Ingress Controller which acts upon the rules set by the Ingress Resource, typically via an HTTP or L7 load balancer. It is vital that both pieces are properly configured to route traffic from an outside client to a Kubernetes Service. The following yaml creates two ingress rules for the website foo.bar.com The default path will direct traffic to the service \u201cdefault-service\u201d which listens on port 80 Paths ending in /foo will direct traffic to the service \u201cservice1\u201d which listens on port 4200 Paths ending in /bar will direct traffic to the service \u201cservice2\u201d which listens on port 8080 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: simple-fanout-example spec: rules: - host: foo.bar.com http: paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: default-service port: number: 80 - path: /foo pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: service1 port: number: 4200 - path: /bar pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: service2 port: number: 8080 In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running.

Use kubectl kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND] instead. / # cat /etc/resolv.conf nameserver 10.43.0.10 search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local eu-central-1.compute.internal options ndots:5 10.43.0.10 being the coredns service object: > kubectl get svc -n kube-system NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kube-dns ClusterIP 10.43.0.10 <none> 53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP 16d To test resolution, we can run a pod with nslookup to test. For the pod below: > kubectl get po -o wide NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES web-server 1/1 Running 0 2d20h 10.42.1.31 ip-172-31-36-67 <none> <none> Knowing the format of the A record: pod-ip-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example We should be able to resolve 10-42-1-31.default.pod.cluster.local . Tip : To determine the cluster domain, inspect the coredns configmap.
